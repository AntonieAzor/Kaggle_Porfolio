# Antonie Azor - Data Analytics Portfolio

Hi, I’m Antonie and this is my Data Analytics Portfolio.

Welcome!
This repository is a small collection of data analysis projects I’ve been working on while completing the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate and building practical, hands-on experience with real datasets.

I’m interested in projects where I can combine clear thinking, attention to detail, and curiosity about data to help answer questions with real-life applications.

Each project here links to a full Kaggle notebook so you can see how I approached the analysis, not just the final output.

## What I’m Practising & Improving:

Cleaning and preparing messy datasets

Exploring data to understand structure, patterns, and limitations

Using spreadsheets (Google Sheets / Excel) to analyse and summarise data

Writing SQL queries in BigQuery

Explaining findings clearly and logically

## Tools I’m Using:

Google Sheets / Excel

SQL (BigQuery)

Kaggle Notebooks

GitHub

Markdown

## Projects:
1) *Netflix Movies & TV Shows — Data Analysis*

What this project is about:
An exploratory analysis of the Netflix Movies & TV Shows dataset, focusing on understanding the structure of the data, cleaning it effectively, and answering some basic questions about the content available on the platform.

What I focused on here:

Inspecting and cleaning the dataset

Dealing with missing and inconsistent values

Organising analysis steps clearly

Documenting decisions as I went

## How This Repo Is Organised:

This README acts as a high-level overview

Each project links out to a Kaggle notebook

Screenshots are stored in the respective project folder

The goal is clarity over complexity

## What I’m Learning Next:

More advanced SQL (joins, aggregations, and querying larger datasets)

Better ways to communicate insights visually

Structuring projects so they’re easy for others to follow

A quick note

This portfolio is very much a work in progress.
I’m deliberately focusing on building solid fundamentals and clearly explaining my thinking, rather than rushing to “flashy” results.

Thanks for taking a look!
